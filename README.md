## Name of the Project: _CryptoKart_
<br /> 

## Tagline: _A mile ahead of time._ 
<br />

## About the Project
> This project leverages the Blockchain technology and Circle API to create an e-commerce platform targeted towards benefiting both the sellers and customers through an automated invoice discounting system built on top of crypto currency (USDC) and creating an abstraction between the customer and the complex nature of handling transactions on the Blockchain(Circle API).

## Problems Solved                                                                               
### Instant Settlements & Instant Refunds

</p>  

>Leveraging the power of the Tron Blockchain, we have provided the customer as well as the seller with quicker transactions like never seen before on any ecommerce platform. Traditionally the customer has to pay for products by entering their card details time and again on the website and also have to wait for 3-4 days on an average for any sort of refund. We have solves this issue by performing all of the transactions on top of the Blockchain. On the sellers side the wait is even longer since the conventional payment aggrefators process the payments via banks and the banking system itslef is not capable of processing the transactions in minutes. <br/> To solve the above mentioned problems we make use of the concept of 'Invoice Discounting' which is traditionally used as a business model by the banks to settle payments of higher credit and better profitability. Such requirnments are not necessary anymore due to the incorporation of blockchain which processes the settlements within few minutes. Since the customers have to pay using their credit cards which will take 3-4 days for settlement we use a beneficary in the middle to pre-pay the seller a discounted invoice (98% of the original value, 2% will be kept as profit by the beneficary to wait for the settlement and thus reward him for this risk). Refunds are managed in the same way and the beneficary deals with the seller separately.

### Trace Transactions

</p> 

> One of the major benefits of a public blockchain like Tron is that the transactions taking place on the blockchain are available to everyone on the blockexplorer(TronScan). Thus, the transactions between the buyers and the sellers can be traced by both the parties as well as the beneficary. In this way any denial of payment by any party is not possible making the system even more secure than traditional e-commerce platforms.

### Abstraction
> <p align="center">
  <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Tw1dGQ0R/diagram1.jpg" />
</p>

> Since customers are used to traditional payment methods like credit cards ,wire transfers etc, we have taken this into account and saved the customer from directly transacting on the blockchain which is usually considered as more complex since it is an emerging technology and not used by many customers. We do this using the Circle APIs which provide an abstraction by blending traditional payment systems and the stablecoin ecosystem (USDC). When transacting on CryptoKart you feel like you paying as usual but behind the scenes all transactions are taking place on the blockchain.
